Uno [studio](http://www.thisislondon.com/lifeandstyle/articles/10888681?source=Evening%20Standard) proveniente dall'Inghilterra ha [classificato](http://www.thisislondon.com/lifeandstyle/articles/10889520?source=Evening%20Standard) 10 tipi di consumatore di alimenti: dal fondamentalista del bio o dallo scioperato che mangia bene solo dai suoi, fino a quello che mangia bene per 5 giornu sette e poi si strafoga di porcherie nei weekend.

2. **Weekend Junkies**: eat healthily through the week but resort to takeaways at weekends
3. **Sandwich & Soup Students**: feel they don't have the time or money to eat healthily. Put alcohol before food
4. **Return To Nesters**: return home to raid their parents' fridge ... and get their washing done at the same time
5. **Chaotic Singles**: eat takeaways, restaurant or pub food or heat up ready-meals
6. **Monday Morning Detoxers**: in the gym or nibbling a lettuce leaf on Monday but at the pub by Tuesday
7. **Food Faddists**: embrace the latest diet like a religion, are likely to stock up on Atkins-friendly products
8. **Earth Mothers**: limit their children's intake of sweets and fizzy drinks, tending to cook a roast on Sunday and "proper meals" during the week
9. **Organic Disciples**: healthconscious and anxious about salt, sugar and fat
10. **Childless Carousers**: eat out as much as possible, and buy top-ofthe-range ready-to-cook meals when eating in.
