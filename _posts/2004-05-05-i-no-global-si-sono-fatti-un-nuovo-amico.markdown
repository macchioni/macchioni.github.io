E' Jean-FranÃ§ois Revel, vate liberale francese, che in un [articolo](http://www.taemag.com/issues/articleid.18005/article_detail.asp) su American Entreprise attacca duramente i no global. 


> But today's anti-globalists are much more than false prophets. Their violence has gone far beyond legitimate protest into real savagery. They have killed people through charming acts like bombing McDonald's restaurants. In Seattle, Nice, Genoa, and other cities, rioters destroyed millions of dollars worth of property and attacked officials and police.
Anti-globalists have tried to replace democracy with a despotism of the mob, advancing the brutal proposition that street demonstrators are more legitimate than elected governments. Wherever they have been active, their goal has been to prevent elected heads of state or appointed officials of international organizations from meeting.
Like other totalitarians, they treat the mere expression of ideas contrary to their slogans as a crime. Anti-globalizers have no ambition to advance a program by democratic means, for the simple reason that they don't have a program, or coherent ideas, or facts on their side.
