[Craig Semetko](http://www.semetko.com/) è un fotografo reportagista che scatta molto in bianco e nero ed è diventato abbastanza famoso nel giro degli amanti della street photography almeno per questi motivi:

- Ha cominciato a fotografare abbastanza tardi, prima faceva un altro lavoro.
- Ha debuttato a Los Angeles in una mostra che affiancava lui a un certo [Henri Cartier-Bresson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson).
- È diventato un uomo [Leica](http://it.leica-camera.com/), o come si dice.
- Si presenta così: "I'm a guy with a camera from Los Angeles".
- Ha una certa ironia e ogni tanto fotografa cani "alla [Elliott Erwitt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Erwitt)" (ma chi non ci ha mai provato?).

Io l’ho conosciuto tardi, ascoltandolo [in una puntata](http://ibarionex.net/thecandidframe/2014/5/11/the-candid-frame-231-craig-semetko) del podcast *The Candid Frame* di [Ibarionex Perello](https://twitter.com/Ibarionex). In occasione della presentazione del suo ultimo libro, *[India Unposed](http://indiaunposed.com)*, sabato 30 agosto Semetko ha partecipato a una chat su twitter (#LeicaChat, [qui](http://twitter.com/hashtag/LeicaChat?src=hash)) e ho pensato di raccogliere qui qualche sua risposta. Sintetizzo tutto in maniera un po' inaccurata, ma il ragazzo tanto scatta bene, tanto ignora l'uso delle *mentions* e dei *reply*, quindi ritrovare i veri titolari delle domande è stato laborioso.

## **#LeicaChat** with Craig Semetko

**[@BobBaron](https://twitter.com/BobBaron): One body or two in your travel kit? (You even have an “at home kit”?)**

>[Leica m240](http://it.leica-camera.com/Fotografia/Sistema-M/Leica-M), 35 and 50 summiluxes.

**How much does a camera count?**

>r. clayton--know the camera well enough to not think about it..then pure seeing takes over. and personal vision.

**[@rcmwandering](https://twitter.com/rcmwandering): How much of your work is about using the camera and how much is about something else entirely?**

>To me a qood picture has a sense of design, provides information, and has emotion...

**[leibniz](https://twitter.com/leibniz): When you're trying to shoot something new, what's your best ally: time (patience, etc..) or distance (India...)?**

>hi piero-mainly time, but new places provide new stimulation India was unlike anything i'd seen before, and my fascination shows.

**[@mborkowskiphoto](https://twitter.com/mborkowskiphoto): Hi Craig, What's a bit of advice you'd give an emerging photographer? Also, do you need an assistant 😄?**

>matt--study the masters, in photography and painting, movies, lit, etc. practice observing. you don't need an assistant to start.

**Thanks, Craig! I actually meant do YOU need an assistant (me)? The 140 characters thing doesn't help with inflection...**

>matt--no worries:) i don't use an assistant, but frankly could use one :) 

>Looking at Cartier-Bresson’s work never hurt anybody...

**[@sastraaawijaya](https://twitter.com/sastraaawijaya): What is the important step to become a street photographer? And where is the place for an amateur to publish his art?**

>sastra--for me, it started as another way to tell stories. then you need to spend a great deal of time roaming the street. 


**[@lalengzuala](https://twitter.com/lalengzuala): How did you study system of design (Root rectangles, etc) Any recommended materials?**

>lalengzuala--no, i did not study the [root system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system)--took art classes as a kid and always liked geometry...but not math :)

**[@ArizRizvi](https://twitter.com/ArizRizvi): How do you engage with your human subjects when you shoot close without making them conscious?**

>ariz-every situation is different. work fast. act like you're looking elsewhere and don't know how to use the camera :)

**[@mactonius](https://twitter.com/mactonius): "act like you're looking elsewhere" and if you get caught, say "you remind me my dead grandfather" (or what else)**

**[leibniz](https://twitter.com/leibniz): Have you any suggestion for the ones of us who #believeinfilm and shoot the #analog way?**

>piero--film is wonderful-if you are passionate about it use it. do what you are passionate about. the rest takes care of itself. I've no immediate plans for film, but one never knows...

**[@pikturdis](https://twitter.com/PIKTURDIS): What's the best analog camera you suggest?**

>pikturdis--I still love my leica mp...it fits my hands perfectly and is mechanical perfection.

**Why "India Unposed?"**

>i'd always wanted to see india, for instance, the leica 10x10 came up, my sister had a fulbright there so i had a place to stay...

**[@Timmvers](https://twitter.com/Timmvers): How do you choose your projects?**

>joseph--it seems they choose me--serendipity has always played a big part in my life. india was a perfect example.

**[@vey952](https://twitter.com/vey952): Is there an image of "India Unposed" that emotionally resonates more than others?**

>barb, so many of them do...right now I am moved by the boy and elephant from india and the two young men rowing at night.
