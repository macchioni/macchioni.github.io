Joe Klein su Time spiega perche Hillary Clinton farebbe meglio a [evitare la corsa alla Casa Bianca](http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,1059000,00.html) (e lasciare queste cose [a Geena Davis](http://mae.splinder.com/1115654569#4730676)).

> [She] is a judicious hawk on foreign policy and has learned her
lessons on domestic-policy overreach. No less an expert than Newt
Gingrich says, "Hillary has become one of the very few people who
know what to do about health care." Still, she has some very real
political limitations. She has a clenched, wary public presence,
which won't work well in an electorate that prizes aw-shucks
informality; she isn't a particularly warm or eloquent speaker,
especially in front of large audiences. Any woman running for
President will face a toughness conundrum: she will constantly have
to prove her strength and be careful about showing her emotions. She
won't have the luxury of, say, Bill Clinton's public sogginess. It
will take a brilliant politician to create a credible feminine
presidential style. So far, Senator Clinton hasn't shown the ease or
creativity necessary to break the ultimate glass ceiling.
