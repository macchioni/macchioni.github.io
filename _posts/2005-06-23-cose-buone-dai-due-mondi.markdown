Roger Cohen s'inventa l'[Eumerica](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/06/21/news/globalist.php).
Un posto dove il caffe sarebbe italiano, i limiti di velocita tedeschi,
il clima spagnolo, professori e aria condizionata americani, le rette
scolastiche europee, la vodka polacca, la birra ceca e la cioccolata
belga. Sport nazionali: calcio e baseball.  


> In Eumerica, a land boasting the bracing wide-open beaches of North
America but also sun-baked coves reminiscent of the Mediterranean, a
place where taxi drivers do not grumble and waiters do not speechify, a
country where the cocktails are as good as the wine, there would not be
an unemployment rate of over 10 percent, as there is in France and
Germany.
No, there would be full employment, or something close, because
companies would be able to hire and fire as they do in the United
States, and sophisticated capital markets would encourage innovation
and risk, and nobody would be able to make more money from not working
and getting benefits than from working, and the French 35-hour week and
other silly regulations would be bad memories.  
Realism would also lead Eumericans to accept that, in a dangerous
world, a strong military is essential to maintain peace and the values
of an open society for which they stand. As a last resort, and as far
as possible in concert with their allies and international
institutions, they would be ready to fight wars. They would scoff at
notions of some postnationalist utopia spreading across the globe and
rendering armies obsolete.
