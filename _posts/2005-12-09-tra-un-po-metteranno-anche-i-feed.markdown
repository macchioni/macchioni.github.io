Quelli del premio Pulitzer [hanno sterzato](http://bayosphere.com/blog/dan_gillmor/20051207/a_semi-coherent_policy_on_online_pulitzers) decisamente verso il mondo che legge (e, per quello che puÃ², scrive) online.

> The Pulitzer Prize Board announced today that newspapers may submit online material as well as print content in all 14 of its journalism categories, starting with the 2006 competition.   
[...]In two categories -- Breaking News Reporting and Breaking News Photography -- an entry consisting entirely of material published online will be permitted. In other categories, an entry may contain online material but it must also contain material published in the newspaper's print edition.
