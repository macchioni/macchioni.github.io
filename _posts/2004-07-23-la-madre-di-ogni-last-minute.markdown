Vacanze alle porte, se qualcuno dovesseÂ varcare il Mediterraneo ecco [le 10 regole da seguire per guidare in Tunisia](http://www.subzeroblue.com/archives/001478.html). Leibniz ne mette tre:


> **1.** Get in the car and make sure you don't fasten your seat belt. (It's considered a bad habit.)
**2.** Try to avoid looking in your side mirrors or front mirror. Mirrors in cars are made only to check on your appearance.
**3.** Before you start your engine, make sure a car is passing by, And then start driving.
