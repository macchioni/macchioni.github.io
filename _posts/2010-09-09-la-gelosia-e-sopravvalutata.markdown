> Jealousy, I discovered, simply leads nowhere, if not to sadness. I don't hand my happiness over to others with the expectation they will guard it as their own. Doesn't mean I don't hand it over. I do. But, even in love, maybe especially in love, your happiness is your own responsibility.


Tom Chiarella, "[Overcoming Jealousy](http://www.esquire.com/the-side/feature/women-advice/overcoming-jealousy?click=pp). How to Stop Being Jealous". Leggi anche, pretesto riflessivo per andare su Esquire e, poi, guardare lo [speciale sulle cheerleader](http://www.esquire.com/the-side/cheerleaders/nfl-cheerleaders-2010?click=pp#fbIndex1) senza troppi sensi di colpa.
