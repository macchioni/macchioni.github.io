E' estate anche per le rubriche politiche. E in Inghilterra c'è chi si chiede se [Winnie The Pooh sia o meno un buon conservatore](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2088-2291291.html).

> Would Winnie-the-Pooh vote Conservative? In a Commons motion to congratulate Pooh on his 80th birthday, Andrew Rosindell — a traditional roast beef sort of Tory MP — praises his “fine values”. **But Pooh is really more of a modern, compassionate Conservative**. Not only did he **welcome immigrants** to the Hundred Acre Wood (Tigger, Kanga and Baby Roo) and **build a house for homeless** Eeyore, but he led a celebrated **expotition to the North Pole where he’ll have seen for himself the effects of global warming**.
