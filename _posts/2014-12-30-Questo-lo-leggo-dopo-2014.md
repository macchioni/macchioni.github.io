Fino all’anno scorso il “secondo schermo” era quello che affiancavamo alla tv: un laptop, più spesso uno smartphone, qualche volta un tablet, raramente un ebook reader. Quest’anno, 2014, ancora per poco, la tv è diventata ufficialmente il secondo schermo: gli smartphone sono grandi quasi come tablet e sono il “primo schermo” quasi per tutti. Il 2015, sembra proprio, sarà l’anno dei wearable. Con l’Apple Watch a guidare la nuova suggestione globale. 

La premessa su primi e secondi schermi, fatta da me che ho la tv staccata dall’antenna da circa 5 anni, serve a dire che quest’anno ho letto molti contenuti “giornalistici” usando lo smartphone e [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/). Sono quelle letture che ti salvi quando non hai tempo e poi consumi in sala d’aspetto dal dottore, in treno, in tram. Oppure non le leggi proprio, ma sai che stanno lì. Ecco, negli ultimi mesi, usando [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), ho creato una ricetta con l’intenzione di raccoglierle tutte in un post - questo - e condividerle con voi volenterosi. Non è come [Un pugno di articoli bellissimi](http://www.francescocosta.net/2014/09/11/un-pugno-di-articoli-bellissimi/) di Francesco Costa, ma nemmeno vuole esserlo. È un qualcosa “molto 2014” che può servire anche nel 2015. <mark>E poi di [tl;dr](http://bit.ly/13DvwJz) non ce n’è mai abbastanza.</mark>
