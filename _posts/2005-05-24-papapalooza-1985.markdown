Altro che gioventu nazista, andando indietro di vent'anni e stato
ripescato un discorso di Ratzinger piuttosto [poco aperto verso la
musica rock](http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/GE17Aa01.html):  

  



> ... Rock music seeks release through
liberation from the personality and its
responsibility ... [it is] among the anarchic
ideas of freedom which today [1985] predominate
more openly in the West than in the East. But
that is precisely why rock music is so
completely antithetical to the Christian concept
of redemption and freedom, indeed its exact
opposite. Hence music of this type must be
excluded from the Church on principle, and not
merely for aesthetic reasons, or because of
restorative crankiness or historical
inflexibility.
