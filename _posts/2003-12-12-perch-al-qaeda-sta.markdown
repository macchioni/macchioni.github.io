 ** Perche al-Qaeda sta vincendo   
** L'opinione e di  [   Correlli Burnett](http://www.spectator.co.uk/article.php3?table=old&section=current&issue=2003-12-13&id=3835)   :  secondo lui le campagne in Afghantistan e in Iraq non hanno indebolito i terroristi.

Washington must recognise that combating terrorists is essentially a job for special forces like the SAS, for the police or gendarmerie (or troops trained in a gendarmerie role) and, above all, for good intelligence (meaning, at best, spies inside al-Qa'eda cells) -- and not a job for heavy-weight hi-tech firepower.
