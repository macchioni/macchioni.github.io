   ** Qui pero si parla di Gulag   
** Oggi Leibniz si e imbattuto in un  [   articolo ](http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110003424)uscito ieri (" _ Chain of Misery. _  _ Was the Soviet gulag economically rational_?") e incuriosito ha letto di un  [   libro ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767900561/qid=1051687687/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-4231146-4498529?v=glance&s=books)scritto da Anne Applebaum. Nell'articolo in questione si legge anche la sua tesi di fondo:

> Ms. Applebaum grants that the Soviet camp system was not created, as the Nazi death camps were, for mass extermination. Yet no imaginable brutality or brutishness, no violation of human dignity, seems missing here. [...] As an institution the Gulag reflected the Bolshevik drive to remake the human personality by remaking the world of work: hence the term "corrective labor." To achieve this aim, Soviet leaders were ready to enforce their own ideas, however bizarre, of what constituted a "rational use" of the manpower at their disposal.
