[Clive Crook](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-24/who-lost-the-euro) sull'ultimo numero di Bloomberg Businessweek (che, per inciso, ha realizzato [una cover da prendere a testate](http://richardturley.tumblr.com/post/23670064280/bang-head-here-euro-crisis-special-edition)):


> Decades of clichés about European “solidarity” and “the European idea” are being held up to ridicule. The notion that Greeks, Spaniards, Britons, Germans, and Italians are instinctive partners whose commonalities transcend their cultural differences and historical enmities—that “Europe” is a real community, not just a heavily worked-over blueprint in Brussels—turns out to be, let’s say, disputable. Ancient stereotypes are as livid as ever [...] **Germans are bossy and severe. Italians are idle. Greeks are corrupt. Brits are arrogant. The French are vain.** So much for 60 years of European unification.
