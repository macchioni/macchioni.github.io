> We are constantly dazzled and blinded by power. We tend to allow and enable our leaders to play by a different set of moral rules and laws. While we distract ourselves with stupid selfies and pictures of our latest dinner, the real world around us spins out of control. Will we go down in history as the generation of connectivity that constantly disconnected itself from reality? I say - to hell with success and authority.
