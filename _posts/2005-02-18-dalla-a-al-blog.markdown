Adesso pure [Peggy Noonan](http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110006302) si e messa a scrivere (entusiasticamente) di blog utilizzando comodi schemini:




> 

> 
> 1. They use the tools of journalists (computer, keyboard, a spirit
of inquiry, a willingness to ask the question) and of the Internet
(Google, LexisNexis) to look for and find facts that have been
overlooked, ignored or hidden. 
> 
> 

> 
> 2. Bloggers, unlike reporters at elite newspapers and magazines, are
independent operators. They are not, and do not have to be, governed by
mainstream thinking. 
> 
> 

> 
> 3. Bloggers have an institutional advantage in terms of technology and form. They can post immediately.  
> 
> 

> 
> 4. Bloggers are also selling the smartest take on a story. They're selling an original insight, a new area of inquiry.  
> 
> 

> 
> 5. And they're doing it free.  




Se volete qualcosa di piu divertente, ecco invece [Know thy enemy: blogs](http://www.imao.us/archives/002701.html), che si trova su Imao. Ci sono cose spiritose come:




> 

> 
> * If you see a **geeky looking male** or a **slutty looking female**
in front of a laptop, he or she could be a blogger. Don't make eye
contact or say anything in front of them or they will destroy you. 
> 
> 

> 
> * If blogs continue in their present march of destruction, the regular media will fall and **you'll get all your information from what some guy named "Phil" can hack out during his coffee break**. Even the greatest minds in science fiction could not imagine such a dystopic future.
