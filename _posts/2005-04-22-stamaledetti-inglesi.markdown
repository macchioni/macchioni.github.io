La cosa del Ratzinger nazista (perche a 14 anni era nella gioventu
Hitleriana, come da obbligo in un paese allora altamente poco
democratico) ha fatto arrabbiare tantissimo la stampa tedesca, che [ha attaccato](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/news/archives/world_news/2005/04/21/still_mentioning_the_war.html) direttamente i giornali inglesi responsabili dell'accostamento paragonandoli al diavolo in persona:  



> Your headlines about the German pope stink of him, like sulphur and
rotten eggs. Anyone reading the British tabloids yesterday must have
thought Hitler had become pope. You obviously view every Kraut as a
Nazi, even the Pope. Only the devil could come up with such
thoughts. Or, unfortunately, you English with your complexes. It's just
like on the football pitch - we are always the Nazis [...] I don't hate
you back. The Pope in his goodness will pray for you idiots - the
editor in chief of the Sun and the Mirror. Even idiots go to heaven.
