Tutti a parlare di Mario Capecchi e nessuno che elogi Mayu Yamamoto, [che è riuscito a estrarre il profumo di vaniglia dalle feci di vacca](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7026150.stm) (sì, sono gli Ig Nobel):

Linguistics - A University of Barcelona team for showing that rats are unable to tell the difference between a person speaking Japanese backwards and somebody speaking Dutch backwards.

Literature - Glenda Browne of Blue Mountains, Australia, for her study of the word "the", and how it can flummox those trying to put things into alphabetical order.
