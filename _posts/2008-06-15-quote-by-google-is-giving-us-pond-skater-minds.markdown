> We just have to find a new equilibrium [...]. We need to be both pond-skaters and scuba divers. We need to master the ability to access facts while reserving time and space to do something mean-ingful with them.




> Some have suggested a web sabbath a day or two in the week when we force ourselves not to read e-mails or post blogs or text messages; a break in order to think in the old way again: to look at human faces in the flesh rather than on a Facebook profile, to read a book rather than a blog, to pray rather than browse. I think I'll start with Nietzsche at some point. But right now I have a blog to fill.
