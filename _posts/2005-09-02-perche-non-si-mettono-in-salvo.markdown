A proposito di Katrina, [Volker Weber](http://vowe.net/archives/006268.html) fa una riflessione che si sente spesso in questi giorni. Eccola:

> When
the WTC towers collapsed you could see people walking over the
bridges out of Manhattan. When the tube was closed down in London,
people started walking. But when I look at the pictures from News
Orleans, I see people sitting in front of the convention center doing
absolutely nothing. They are throwing around their trash, they don't
try to organize clean areas and dirty ones, they are not walking out
over the bridge that happens to be right in front of the convention
center. Is that because people in New York and London knew that they
were walking home or is it that these people need to be told what to
do? Why can't they take their life into their own hands and walk out of
there?
