Two things I read last weekend via [Hacker Newsletter](http://mailchi.mp/hackernewsletter/360?e=69e4c56ba1) about Facebook manners and limits (and our manners and limits).

* [Blake Watson: Why I left Facebook](https://www.blakewatson.com/journal/why-i-left-facebook):

> Over time, we’ve become hooked on the social validation Facebook (and other services) provide. Before I hit the delete button on my account, one of the last things that kept me on Facebook—after I had largely stopped posting and reading the News Feed—was simply checking my notifications. I unconsciously craved that little hit of happiness one gets when they see, So-and-so liked your post. But that’s not real happiness. It’s an unhealthy addiction.

* [Chris Aldrich: The Facebook Algorithm Mom Problem](http://boffosocko.com/2017/07/11/the-facebook-algorithm-mom-problem/), or How I temporarily cut my mom out of my social media life to reach a larger audience: 

> __mom-autolike (n.)__  When a mother automatically clicks “like” on a piece of content posted to social media by one of their children, not because it has any inherent value, but simply because the content came from their child.

_PS: This post is also a webmention test. Feedback appreciated._
