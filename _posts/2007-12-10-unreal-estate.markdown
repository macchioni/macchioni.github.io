Pare che la nuova serie tv americana [Gossip Girl](http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_Girl) [non sia poi tanto credibile](http://www.observer.com/2007/gossip-girl-dangerous-yes) come rappresentazione del mercato immobiliare di New York.

> Gossip Girl is spreading throughout the United States a disjunctive, distorted, ultimately dangerous, view of what buys what in New York City right now, and the show's doing so mostly through its depiction of real estate. Like Friends in the 1990's and Sex and the City earlier this decade, Gossip Girl is giving the impression to Suzy in Nebraska and Mandy in Alabama (and Clay from Texas) that real estate in New York is as affordable as anywhere and that poor in New York means living in a $2 million Williamsburg loft.
