[Il discorso](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-12-18-bush-text_x.htm) di Bush sulla guerra in Iraq:

> Defeatism may have its partisan uses, but it is not justified by the facts. For every scene of destruction in Iraq, there are more scenes of rebuilding and hope. For every life lost, there are countless more lives reclaimed. And for every terrorist working to stop freedom in Iraq, there are many more Iraqis and Americans working to defeat them. My fellow citizens: Not only can we win the war in Iraq â€” we are winning the war in Iraq.
