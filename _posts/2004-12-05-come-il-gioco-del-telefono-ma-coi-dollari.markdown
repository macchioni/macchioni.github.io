L'ultima delle strategie pubblicitarie sarebbe il passaparola, [scrive](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/magazine/05BUZZ.html?ex=1259989200&en=6dc3f3878659a642&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland)
il Times. Sembra una stupidaggine, ma funziona. Una ditta di wurstel di
pollo si e affidata a certi pubblicitari che non hanno fatto che
mobilitare un bel po' di persone affinche creassero il fenomeno tra la
gente. Questo, per esempio, e stato quello che ha fatto una volontaria
(non pagata), di nome Gabriella, per la societa Al Fresco:

> At one grocery store, Gabriella asked a manager why there was no Al
Fresco sausage available. At a second store, she dropped a card touting
the product into the suggestion box. At a third, she talked a stranger
into buying a package. She suggested that the organizers of a
neighborhood picnic serve Al Fresco. She took some to a friend's house
for dinner and (she reported back) ''explained to her how the sausage
comes in six delicious flavors.'' Talking to another friend whom she
had already converted into an Al Fresco customer, she noted that the
product is ''not just for barbecues'' and would be good at breakfast
too. She even wrote to a local priest known for his interest in Italian
food, suggesting a recipe for Tuscan white-bean soup that included Al
Fresco sausage. The priest wrote back to say he'd give it a try.
Gabriella asked me not to use her last name. The Al Fresco campaign is
over -- having notably boosted sales, by 100 percent in some stores --
but she is still spreading word of mouth about a variety of other
products, and revealing her identity, she said, would undermine her
effectiveness as an agent. 




La stessa cosa era stata fatta con dei telefonini Sony Ericsson nel '92 oppure, dalla stessa societa pubblicitaria, con [un libro](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573229385/ref=nosim/edazzlenet-20/102-8078111-4377768?dev-t=08FC0AFA9SSP0BEHY8G2).
