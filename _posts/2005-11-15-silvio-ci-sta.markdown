Quello su Tony Blair che [annuncia l'abolizione delle elezioni](http://www.owen.org/spoof/abolished.htm) Ã¨ il fake del giorno (di ieri).



> Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said that "even the chance of a change of government would be a
victory for the terrorists".

"We must not let them change our way of life", said Mr Blair. "Terrorism will not be defeated until our determination is as complete as theirs, our defence of freedom as absolute as their fanaticism, our passion for our way of life as great as their passion for tyranny."
