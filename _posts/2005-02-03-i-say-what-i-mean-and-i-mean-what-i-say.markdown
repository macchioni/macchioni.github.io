Bush ha tenuto il [discorso sullo Stato dell'Unione](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-02-02-sou-text_x.htm),
spiegando la riforma della Social Security per evitare l'inevitabile
bancarotta (che prima o poi tocca a tutti gli stati). Ha parlato anche
di liberta economica ('Justice is distorted, and our
economy is held back, by irresponsible class actions and frivolous
asbestos claim') e dei principi che regolano l'assistenza dello stato
('A taxpayer dollar must be spent wisely, or not at all'). Ha esordito
salutando i nuovi leader eletti nei Territori, in Afghanistan, in Iraq
e in Ukraina. Quindi lo scoppiettante finale, retorico ma d'effetto:

> **The attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom's power to change the world**.
We are all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in
our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to
spread the peace that freedom brings.   
As Franklin Roosevelt once reminded Americans, "_Each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth_".
And we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. The
abolition of slavery was only a dream until it was fulfilled. The
liberation of Europe from fascism was only a dream until it was
achieved. The fall of imperial communism was only a dream until, one
day, it was accomplished.   
Our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. **The road of providence is uneven and unpredictable, yet we know where it leads: It leads to freedom **
