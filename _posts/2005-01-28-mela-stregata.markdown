> Here's to the crazy ones... The misfits; the rebels... The
troublemakers... The round pegs in the square holes... The ones who see
things differently... They're not fond of rules, and they have no
respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them,
glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do, is ignore
them; because they change things. They push the human race forward. And
while some may see them as the crazy ones, We see genius... Because the
people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the
ones who do.
