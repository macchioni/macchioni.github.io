![Gene Simmons](http://www.megomuseum.com/gallerymap/circles/kiss.gif)Star e politica. Ci stanno quelli che fanno gli anticonformisti schierandosi contro il potere formale (vedi una qualsiasi intervista di Tim Robbins) e poi c'è Gene Simmons - sì, quello dei Kiss - che rilascia [un'intervista fantastica](http://www.radaronline.com/features/2007/05/gene_simmons_interview_1.php) in cui parla di guerra in Iraq («_The answer seems to be, from some political experts, just get up and leave and the bad guys will decide, "Hey let's disarm and everything's going to be okay." I'm so fucking sick and tired of such idiotic behavior_»), dell'esercito americano («_There's no fame, they're certainly not getting rich, and a lot of them are dying, simply for something they believe. By the way, it's a volunteer army, all volunteer. The fact that anybody would have a fucking thing to say about that is astonishing_»), del vero volto solidale di Hollywood («_The hospital that Sophie and I went to, it's about an hour and a half down the road from Malibu. These morons can't get up off their asses and out of their $10 million homes, get into their SUVs, and drive down to the VA hospital just to say, "Hey, what you do matters"_»), delle grandi band del pianeta come Rem e U2 («_They sell T-shirts, too. It's just that we can do things no other band can do. There ain't no Rolling Stones comic books_») e di altre cosette divertenti.
