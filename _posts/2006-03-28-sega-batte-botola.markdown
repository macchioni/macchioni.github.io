Uno sta lÃ¬ a testa bassa, per non aver mai visto una puntata di Lost, ed ecco che qualcuno lo conforta di aver [puntato sul cavallo vincente](http://www.tv.com/story/story.html&story_id=3844).


> It's only fun to be in the dark if you feel like you're being taken care of. **On 24**, you know that no matter how implausible and crazy it seems right then, **by the end of the season the bad guys will be dead and Jack will have decimated his personal life** in the process.
On Lost, will we even get to learn what "the countdown" is? Will we learn what that grey smoke-thing is? Where is the polar bear? Will we ever actually know what the mystery of the island is? More importantly, do the show's writers even know? **Lost is the perpetual tease, and it's becoming too much.**
