Conn Iggulden, quello del "[Pericoloso libro delle cose da veri uomini](http://www.bol.it/libri/scheda/ea978880456524.html)", [elogia l'avventura, le ginocchia sbucciate e l'urina come inchiostro simpatico](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062201668_pf.html) per stroncare la pedagogia dei giorni nostri (che ha prodotto, causa genitori distratti, grassi bulli mammoni che non leggono):


> The irony of making boys' lives too safe is that later they take worse risks on their own. You only have to push a baby boy hard on a swing and see his face light up. It's not learned behavior -- he's hardwired to enjoy a little risk. Ask any man for a good memory from childhood and he'll tell you about testing his courage or getting injured. No one wants to see a child get hurt, but we really did think the bumps and scratches were badges of honor, once.
