Secondo Francis Fukuyama al mondo arabo manca ancora il suo Martin Lutero.

In the Arab and Muslim worlds liberal voices exist but politically they are not listened to. Actually, I think the important struggle is the political struggle. For instance, if you look at someone like Abdolkarim Soroush, the theorist from Iran, who wants to reconcile Islam and modernity. Probably, there is no single "Luther" but there are voices like that in the Islamic world. Those reformers were waiting for the right time, but they are drowned out by Osama Bin Laden-types.
