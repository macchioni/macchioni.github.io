Hugh MacLeod ha messo online un ipertesto che distribuisce consigli su [come essere creativi](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/001207.html) dato che, dice, 'l'era della creativita e gia davanti a noi'. Qui Leibniz ha estratto i [30 suggerimenti](http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000932.html) per essere creativi sul proprio posto di lavoro:




> 

> 
> 1. Ignore everybody.   
2. The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to change the world.   
3. Put the hours in.   
4. If your biz plan depends on you suddenly being "discovered" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail.   
5. You are responsible for your own experience.   
6. Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in kindergarten.   
7. Keep your day job.   
8. Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with companies that champion creativity.   
9. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.   
10. The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.   
11. Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.   
12. If you accept the pain, it cannot hurt you.   
13. Never compare your inside with somebody else's outside.   
14. Dying young is overrated.   
15.
The most important thing a creative person can learn professionally is
where to draw the red line that separates what you are willing to do,
and what you are not.   
16. The world is changing.   
17. Merit can be bought. Passion can't.   
18. Avoid the Watercooler Gang.   
19. Sing in your own voice.   
20. The choice of media is irrelevant.   
21. Selling out is harder than it looks.   
22. Nobody cares. Do it for yourself.   
23. Worrying about "Commercial vs. Artistic" is a complete waste of time.   
24. Donit worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.   
25. You have to find your own schtick.   
26. Write from the heart.   
27. The best way to get approval is not to need it.   
28. Power is never given. Power is taken.   
29. Whatever choice you make, The Devil gets his due eventually.   
30. The hardest part of being creative is getting used to it.
