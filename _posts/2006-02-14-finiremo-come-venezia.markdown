Questo blog ospita ormai pareri sul declino dell'Europa quasi fosse un libro curato da Ida Magli. Tant'è: sembra che il futuro della ricerca [non avrà propriamente patria in Europa](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11298986/site/newsweek/).


> It's often noted that the European Union has a combined gross domestic product that is approximately the same as that of the United States. But the EU has 170 million more people. Its per capita GDP is 25 percent lower than that of the U.S. and, most important, that gap has been widening for 15 years. If present trends continue, the chief economist at the OECD argues, in 20 years the average U.S. citizen will be twice as rich as the average Frenchman or German. (Britain is an exception on most of these measures, lying somewhere between Continental Europe and the U.S.)
