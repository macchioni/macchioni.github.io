ha letto [questo
articolo](http://www.campusmagazine.org/articledetail.aspx?id=e8e43c5e-eb61-4287-9f2a-249ea7626928) per il Campus Magazine che collega l'utilizzo di
massa dell'iPod (et
similia) alla fine della civilta come noi la conosciamo.
Segue passaggio apocalittico:

> ...iPod is bad for the
soul because it offers a false
sense of control. As Rosen points out, the makers of iPod
have, "created a world where the individual's control over the content,
style, and timing of what he consumes is nearly absolute". She says
that this little machine allows us to "make a fetish of our
preferences". In all things, at
all times, we demand control. We demand
choice. We want omnipotence. The iPod feeds off of a
utopian fantasy:
that we can make our individual world perfect by controlling every nook
and managing every cranny of our lives. We are increasingly ill
equipped to deal with real life. Death does not have a stop button,
sickness and disappointment cannot be skipped with a click-wheel; in
this world we still have trouble. Manipulating every aspect of
existence with technology gives us the impression that control is ours,
but it isn't. We are deceiving ourselves.
