Il famossissimo blogger Joi Ito [e stato a Roma](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/13/off_to_rome.html). Ora, stando al suo report, ha soggiornato [in un alberghetto](http://www.hotelhasslerroma.com/) del centro con una discreta vista, poi ha incontrato gente di Indymedia e ha cenato in [un centro sociale](http://www.casalepodererosa.org/casale/casale.htm). Ecco le sue [considerazioni](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/14/the_italian_squat_scene.html) sull'Italia:

> Internet penetration in Italy is quite low and the Berlusconi media
machine controls most of what people see. On the other hand, the left
wing are fighting hand and fist (literally) with the right wing
radicals. Free speech was something that people were fighting for, in
many cases outside of the law. At a tactical level, my discussion about
freedom of expression and our "Infrastructure of Democracy" idea of
fighting bad speech with more good speech sounded a bit idealistic.
What was interesting to me was the power and the energy of the
alternative media movement. It reminds me of my theory on good
alternative music. When there is a huge force pressing down on
freedoms, sub-cultures with more creativity and power are likely to
form.
