Sembra che la prossima primavera il libro da leggere sarà "[Everything Is Miscellaneous](http://www.amazon.com/Everything-Miscellaneous-Power-Digital-Disorder/dp/0805080430/sr=1-6/qid=1168343103/ref=sr_1_6/002-6739376-6061669?ie=UTF8&s=books)" di David Weinberger. Lo ha già spulciato Chris Anderson di Wired, che [scrive](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2007/01/five_books_read.html):


> It will be out in May and yes, that's my blurb on the cover: "The world is messy, like it or not, and it's only going to get messier as the Web destroys rules and rule-makers. You can either complain about the chaos and wish for the good old days of order, or you can buy this book and understand why delirious disorder will soon make us all smarter".
