Jeff Bezos di Amazon [spiega](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.01/bezos.html) le strategie di marketing del suo gruppo e perche preferisce lasciar perdere la pubblicita in tv.

> We did a 15-month-long test of TV advertising in two markets -
Portland, Oregon, and Minneapolis - to see how much it drove our sales.
And it worked, but not as much as the kind of price elasticity we knew

consumers. So we put all that money into lower product prices and free
shipping. That has significantly accelerated the growth of our business.
