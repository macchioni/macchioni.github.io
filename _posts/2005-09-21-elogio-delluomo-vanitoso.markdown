Il deputato conservatore e biondastro Boris Johnson ha scritto che gli uomini sono molto piu vanitosi delle donne. Pero [in fondo va bene perche aiuta a compiere grandi imprese](http://www.boris-johnson.com/archives/2005/09/in_defence_of_t.html).  



> Asked to give a candid self-assessment, women and girls will stick
to "good" or "average" while men of identical abilities will declare
that they are "very good" or "excellent." Girls are much more reluctant
to put up their hands and show off in class, and yet do as well, if not
better in exams. [...] Surely we need this male cognitive dissonance, this refusal to accept
reality, otherwise people would never take the mad risks that have so
benefited the human race - going up in aeroplanes, crossing the
Atlantic, you name it.
