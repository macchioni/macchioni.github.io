[A caccia di oppiacei ](http://www.newsreview.com/issues/Sacto/2005-03-31/cover.asp)nel piu vario negozio online di sempre:  


> There were
online pharmacies on the Internet. I ordered Tramadol from Mexico and
Nurofen Plus with the legal max 12.8 milligrams of codeine per tablet
from New Zealand. Then that got tougher.   
  



  Finally, I found eBay. I had been looking for old motel stationery and
fake Jackson Pollock drip paintings. They sold everything--why not
drugs?  
  

I typed [base "]poppy pods[per thou] into the search bar.  
  

Like
anyone trolling the Internet at 4 a.m., I had been looking for some
kind of temporary drug fix. I found it on eBay under Crafts>Floral
Supplies>Flowers, Foliage>Dried.   
  
Crafting. Sure. I liked art.
