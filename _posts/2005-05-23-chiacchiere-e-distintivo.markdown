Lo scrittore Keith Thompson (un «[Keith chi?](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Keith%20Thompson/104-7851482-1069507)», e concesso) [si e stufato dei tic dei liberal](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/05/22/INGUNCQHKJ1.DTL&type=printable) americani e cambia schieramento annunciandolo sul quotidiano lefty di San Francisco:  


> Leftists who no longer speak of the duties of citizens, but only of the
  rights of clients, cannot be expected to grasp the importance (not least to
our survival) of fostering in the Middle East the crucial developmental
advances that gave rise to our own capacity for pluralism, self-reflection,
and equality. A left averse to making common cause with competent, self-
determining individuals  --  people who guide their lives on the basis of
received values, everyday moral understandings, traditional wisdom, and plain
common sense  --  is a faction that deserves the marginalization it has
pursued with such tenacity for so many years.
