![](http://www.abbedon.com/electricminds/mmo/templates/user/wwj/landing/tokyo/joi_blue.gif)L'altro giorno Joi Ito, esprimendo [alcune sue impressioni sull'Italia](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/14/the_italian_squat_scene.html), c'era andato parecchio pesante (ne abbiamo parlato nel [post qui sotto](http://blogs.it/0100915/2005/03/18.html#a240)). Per riassumerla con le parole di [Cesare](http://zeromedia.it/4b/archivi/2005/03/ma_per_piacere.php): ´_Qualcuno spieghi al 'grande' Joi Ito che l'Italia non Ë proprio come la Corea del Nord_º.
Al guru Ë arrivato qualche commento critico anche da qualche blogger
italiano, anche se il vero alfiere e stato Brodo Primordiale che -
argomentando - e riuscito a far riflettere Joi Ito fino a un parziale
ripensamento. Siccome i permalink nei commenti sono una cosa splendida,
il consiglio e di andare a leggersi la conversazione. Ma [l'esordio pirotecnico](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/14/the_italian_squat_scene.html#c021797) di [Carlo](http://brodoprimordiale.net/) lo incollo qui (ma c'e anche la [versione satirica](http://brodoprimordiale.net/archives/002503.php)):

> You don't really know what you're talking about Ito, next time you
could meet with the local gangs and publish their view on the state of
justice in Italy, that would be interesting. At beginning I thought
your post was so naive that deserved no comments at all, but I saw a
couple of comments that are not only misinformed but offensive other
than completly bs.   
  
First, let's try to get some numbers
straight: according to the latest EU data (February '05), internet
penetration rate in Italy is about 49% of population which is not
stellar but certainly not "very low", if you compare to 41,5% of France
or 32,5 of Spain. UK is at 59%, which I would expect given that 80% of
web content is in English.   
  
Free speech: it is true that
Berlusconi has an unparalleled media power, which is a problem (even if
Berlusconi didn't came from Mars, he was elected and his conflict of
interest and economic power in the communication industry was known to
the voters well before the last elections), but is also true that our
system is far from being limited as far as freedom of speech is
concerned. We have a lot of improvement space as a country and get rid
of Berlusconi next year will be the first step, but the picture of
Italy that comes from your post is just plain ridicolous, a reader with
a normal QI (not Paglione above) would think you were in Saigon or
maybe Pyongyang, not really in Rome.   
  
Regarding your line "the
left wing are fighting hand and fist (literally) with the right wing
radicals", maybe I live in another country or planet, but I don't see
all this hand and fist activity around. I don't usually meet squatters
though. I won't mention other bs I read regarding ars but I'd strongly
suggest you to check you facts before writing about matters of which
you are totally ignorant. 




Quindi [la risposta](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/14/the_italian_squat_scene.html#c021808) di Ito:
