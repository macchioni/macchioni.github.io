  * Evgeny Morozov [recensisce](http://www.thedaily.com/page/2012/01/01/010112-opinions-books-weinberger-morozov-1-3/) “[Too big to know](http://www.toobigtoknow.com/)” di David Weinberger.

  * [The joy of quiet](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/opinion/sunday/the-joy-of-quiet.html) di Pico Iyer sul New York Times

  * [Riot: Self-Organized, Hyper-Networked Revolts—Coming to a City Near You](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_riots/all/1) di Bill Wasik per Wired

  * [Some of my favorite Mac apps in 2011](http://brettterpstra.com/some-of-my-favorite-mac-apps-in-2011/) di Brett Terpstra, responsabile del fatto che io abbia scritto questo post in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)


> I’ve compiled a list of some of my favorite apps from 2011. I wrote a TextMate command to link all of these (60 links in four minutes!).
