Dice Gary Shteyngart:


> In America, everyone writes but no one reads. Everyone's writing all day long – sending emails, tweets, text messages; they all think they're James Cameron's Avatar, performing in some video game for which they make up the script. It's too easy, like a wank. Reading is hard work.


Sarà, ma [leggere lui](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Sad-True-Love-Story/dp/1847081037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1283763117&sr=8-1), più che un duro lavoro, è un piacere. [The Observer]
