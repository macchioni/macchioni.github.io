> Fidel Castro will leave Cuba in a terrible political and economic
mess, just as Mao Zedong left China when he died in 1976, and Castrois

or military leaders, or both, will need to understand that although the
Cuban people put up with abject poverty under Fidel, they will not long
tolerate such conditions under any other leader.
