![](http://www.tacojohns.com/HTML/Graphics/Food/Burritos/Medium/Beef-Burrito.gif)La mia rubrica preferita di questi tempi - oltre a quella di Carlo Rossella su Chi -  è [¡Ask a Mexican!](http://www.laweekly.com/la-vida/ask-a-mexican/ask-a-mexican-dark-matters/16000/) su LA Weekly. Un messicano che risponde a domande curiose sui messicani. Si trovano lettere come queste:


> Have you noticed how all those guys like Bill O’Reilly, Lou Dobbs and Glenn Beck go on and on about Mexicans and immigration? **It seems like they fear the taco truck more than the Taliban.** I think they go nuts because some Mexicans look like Arabs or Muslims. I blame all the prietos for this. That’s why they’re always the bad guys in the telenovelas. Damn prietos always fucking shit up. **Saddam Hussein looked like my freakin’ uncle with the ostrich boots, and I can easily pass for the Iranian president. All I need is a khaki Members Only jacket.**
